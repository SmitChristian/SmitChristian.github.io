            <p>“Take an image of Earth from orbit every minute for 24 hours and send the data and the system’s status
                back to Earth to be processed by a ground station”.</p>
            <p>The mission need statement is like the project objective statement but describes the intended use of the
                CubeSat. To be as specific as possible the exact number and frequency of images were outlined as well as
                where the images will be taken from. This statement will be used to outline the requirements and
                functions that will need to be performed by the CubeSat. Some things that can be inferred from this
                statement are that the CubeSat will need to operate in space conditions, have long-distance
                communications to the ground station, be able to transmit the image fast enough to be ready to transmit
                another one in 60 seconds, and be powered for at least 24 hours, likely with a safety margin.</p>
