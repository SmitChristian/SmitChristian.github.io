                <p>Based on the trade-off table created by the team, it was decided to pursue configuration 2 using the raspberry pi. This choice was based on the weights and grades assigned to each configuration. Using this method of weights and grades showed which configuration was mathematically the most optimal. This concept was averagely complex using entirely off the shelf parts but requiring more electronics due to the Raspberry Pi requiring a more constant operating voltage. The Raspberry Pi also had a strong operational life with the built in redundancy with the battery bank and solar power. The Raspberry Pi chip that was selected also has an adequately high transmission speed as well as a theoretical transmission range that falls within the mission guidelines. The Raspberry Pi also has the most onboard processing power to aid in file compression. The configuration scored a 3 in risk as it will have more points of failure during operation due to the increase in complexity. It also scored a 3 in cost because this configuration opts for an active control system which requires an extra microprocessor and motors. All the configurations obtained the same score for data storage and reliability. This is because all configurations have the same solution for data storage which is to get an onboard micro-SD card. As, for reliability most of the failure points across the configurations are the same yielding similar results.</p>
