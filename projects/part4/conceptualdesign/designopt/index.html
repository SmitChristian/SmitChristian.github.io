                <p>The three major design choices that were evaluated in the design option tree were the choices for the control system, central processing unit, and the power system. These are the three main factors that the various concepts depend on. The central processing unit determines the operating voltage of the system and therefore the design of the power control system. The design for the power control system is broken down into two parts. Using solar panels to help reduce the load on the batteries or designing the power system to have enough battery capacity to sustain the CubeSat through its 24-hour mission. The design of the power system depends on the choice of processor. There were three designs that got considered.  One of them was to use a raspberry pi, the next was to use an Arduino, and the last was to assemble a custom circuit board from commercially available chips and components. The final design consideration was to choose what kind of control system is to be used to maintain the mission goal of keeping the satellite pointed at the earth. The various choices can be broken down into active and passive systems. The active systems that were considered were compressed gas thrusters and reaction wheels. The two passive systems that were considered are using magnets and using aerodynamic mechanisms to keep the satellite pointed at earth. The pros and cons of each design and why each decision was made will be discussed further in the trade-off table section.</p>
