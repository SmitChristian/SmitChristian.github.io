                <p>The design of the ground station was rather brief. It has one job and that is to receive the file packages from the CubeSat and process them yielding images or system data. With the LoRa hat that was selected to be used as the transceiver, the simplest way to receive the data is with another Waveshare SX1262 915Mhz LoRa HAT. They are designed to work very well with peer-to-peer communication. The initial design called for using the UART to USB built into the hat and plugging the hat directly into a laptop to use as the ground station. However, the software that comes with the LoRa hat for interpreting the data was made in Chinese and proven difficult to use. To fix this issue in a timely manner, with our budget more fleshed out, it was decided to order and use a second raspberry pie as the ground station processing unit. This makes it easier to receive the data from the LoRa hat directly to the I2C pins on the raspberry pi and run them through the python code to process the information. Using a Raspberry Pi at the receiving end also simplified the coding process as it was more familiar regarding the environment and setup processes. With the Raspberry Pi also functioning as a standalone computer it makes it simple to hookup peripherals and a monitor to be able to read and display the received information as well as plenty of on-board space for storage.</p>
