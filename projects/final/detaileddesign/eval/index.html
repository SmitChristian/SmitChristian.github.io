                <p>A key part of the mission is to be able to consistently take photos of earth during the 24-hour mission. To keep earth in frame some kind of control system is required to rotate the satellite’s view. With the current selected orbit, the satellite will have to rotate a full 360 degrees every 1.542 hours.</p>
                <p>Initially it was thought that a full 3-axis control system would be required to be able to take clear images of earth. This idea evolved as it was realized that some assumptions could be made. The only constraint that was given for the image was that it had to be of earth, so automatically the axis that aligns through the camera lens does not need controllability. It was then further assumed that the satellite would be deployed into orbit with no rotational forces acting on it. If this is assumed, then control about the pitch axis (toward and away from the sun) is not needed. Thus, the only axis that needs controllability is the one that must be rotated about to keep earth in frame.  The design process for this system is shown using a design tree in figure 3.3.1.  </p>
                <img src="images/controlTree.png">
                <p>To do this the satellite has one reaction wheel installed inside the shell. The reaction wheel has a 93-gram disk attached to a DC motor. The motor is controlled by the Adafruit DC & Stepper Motor Hat which allows for bi-directional control with 8-bit speed resolution. This motor controller was chosen over the other, smaller, and cheaper option because it allows for manual readdressing of the I2C address that it uses to communicate with the RaspberryPi making it easier to set up and program. These motors, when in a zero-gravity environment, turn on to produce torque with the weighted disk. Since there are no external forces holding the satellite in place, the equal and opposite reaction slowly rotates the satellite in the opposite direction. </p>
                <p>The control system uses the Waveshare Sense HAT for Raspberry Pi. It uses onboard gyroscope chips to measure angular displacement during the mission. The sensor is calibrated at launch to track the angle of its orientation throughout the mission. With the satellite rotating at approximately 0.0011318 rad/s relative to earth, the control system and motors will have to counter this rotation. Assuming that the satellite is to be deployed above the north pole and north is positive, it can be assumed that the desired orientation can be predicted with the equation shown below. It takes orbit time and yields the required angle that the gyroscope must align to relative to the start angle.  Since the satellite is equipped with a 120-degree wide angle lens thus keeping the earth in frame. </p>
                <p>Theta=360*sin⁡(1/2*1/5553.5*t)</p>
                <p>The design only calls for one motor since the orientation of earth within the image frame is not important and we have assumed a deployment with no induced rotational energy. The one motor will be used to correct the yaw direction which changes as a function of time keeping earth in frame.</p>
