                    <p>One of the larger constraints imposed by the project description are that the system must function for a minimum duration of 24 hours. To achieve this goal, it was decided to use a LiPo bank in conjunction with solar panels. </p>
                <p>Battery selection was rather simple as we had to buy off-the-shelf parts due to time constraints. Sourcing a high-capacity rechargeable battery that would be able to fit within our 1.5U design did not prove to be difficult as there were not many options. When selecting the battery, it was narrowed down to three different sizes and capacity batteries as shown below in the design tree. It was finally chosen to go with the Samsung 50S 21700 5000mAh 25A Battery as it yielded the highest capacity for the lowest percent volume it would take up. </p>
                <img src="images/batteryTree.png">
                <p>The next requirement was to select a battery charger. Initially we had selected the HiLetgo TP4056 LiPo charger. This would have been more than capable of supported the estimated current from the solar panels and adequately charged the batteries. Then we investigated a voltage boost converter. Since the raspberry pi requires a constant operating voltage of 5v the power depletion of a battery overtime had to be taken into consideration. It was during this process that the Adafruit PowerBoost 1000 Basic - 5V USB Boost @ 1000mA from 1.8v. This charge controller/boost converter combination allowed us to cut out down our original design while also operating at a 90% charge/discharge efficiency. The controller also has built-in load sharing which means that it can charge the batteries and power the Raspberry Pi at the same time increasing effective efficiency. This charger also works with voltages as low as 1.8v which will work well with our solar panels as they rarely generate their rated 6v. </p>
                <p>The solar panels that were used in our design are 1.2-Watt 6V solar panels from Voltaic Systems. According to their data sheet, the expected power output is estimated to be 1.09 Watts at 5.89v. With our design containing 3 panels, our expected power input can be around 3.27 Watts and accounting for the 90% efficiency of the charger, we can expect 2.944 Watts of power to be accessible to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
                <p>The batteries have a full capacity of 20Ah and at a nominal voltage of 4.2v, they have an energy capacity of 84Wh. With the solar panels producing 2.9W, or 69.6Wh over the 24-hour mission duration it can be further assumed that our total power available is 153.6Wh. The loaded current draw of the selected motors is 0.16A, with a nominal voltage of 3v, the motors power is 0.48W, assuming it operates continuously (which will not be required), it will consume 11.52Wh over the course of the mission. The idle power draw from the Pi4B is 2.85 Watts while the under-load power consumption is estimated to be round 5W. If the Pi will spend 50% of the mission duration under load, the total power consumption of the Pi during the mission comes out to 94.2Wh. The transmit power consumption of the LoRa hat is 0.5W, assuming that we will spend 50% of the mission time transmitting our data, the power consumption is 6.6Wh. The Waveshare Sense hat that we are using as the gyroscope has a current draw of 3.11mA only using 0.26Wh throughout the duration of the mission. This brings our total estimated power consumption, while overestimating power draw, to 112.66Wh. This means our current power system can supply 36% more power over the duration of the mission that we need. This data is further summarized below in table 4.3.1.</p>
