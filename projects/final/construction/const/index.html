                    <!-- Page Content-->
                <p>The manufacturing of the main CubeSat structure began with processing the sheet metal into the correct, usable sizes for the 1.5U CubeSat. Initially the plan was to use a pair of mechanical sheet metal sheers to do this, but this proved harder to cut straight edges and with how the sheers cut the sheet metal the edges would get bent either up or down. Due to this it was decided to opt for a different manufacturing process. The manufacturing defects mentioned can be seen below in figure 4.1. A vertical bandsaw was used to cut the thin sheet metal. This allowed for more precision in assuring that all the panels would be the same size. The same bandsaw was also used to cut the Maker Beams to sizes. Each beam was cut to be 15cm long while four side panels are 15x10cm. The top and bottom panels are each cut to be 10x10cm.</p>
                <p>Once all of the panels and beams were cut to size the next step was to use the drill bits purchased to drill holes for all of the mounting hardware. As per the CAD models, each panel was attached to each beam with three T-nuts and bolts. To drill the holes, first the hole locations had to be marked. The center point for the bolts, when the panels are lined up with the beams, is half a centimeter from the edge of the panel. The top and bottom holes were drilled two centimeters from their respective edge while the middle hole was drilled at the panels center point. This was repeated for both the left and right sides of each panel and for all 4 of the 10x15cm panels. For the top and bottom panels, a hole was drilled in each corner approximately 0.5cm from each side to line up with the center hole of the maker beams. </p>
                <p>During the assembly it was realized that the maker beams were not threaded throughout their entire length, thus the side that had to be cut did not have usable threads to screw into. At this point a 3mm drill bit was taken and the hole was drilled out a little wider. Then a scrap bolt was taken and used to tap the hole. This was a difficult process but appeared to be the only way to be able to secure the top panel to the ends of the beam. The rest of the structure was assembled, and some preliminary stability testing was done, and it was determined that the structure was not as ridged as expected. To help stiffen the system two cross beams were added to the top and bottom. These can be seen in the updated CAD model below in figure 4.2. These new beams were cut to be just under 8cm in length to snugly fit between the two beams on the edges. To secure them to the structure, two holes were drilled in the edges of the plates where the beams are, and T-nuts are fitted into the beams. As an additional method of securing the beams, it was found that a bolt could be inserted into the end of the beam and then slid into the T-slot of the beam it is butted up against. This change provided much better lateral stability. </p>
                <p>With the main structure completed, it was time to start affixing the components of the satellite. The first component to be installed was the motor and motor mount. This required finding the center point on one of the side panels and lining up the motor mount, so the holes are perfectly vertical. Once the motor mount was in the correct position, it was affixed to the panel with tape and then a drill was used to drill through the holes of the motor mount through the panel to ensure proper alignment. Once this was done, the motor mount was bolted to the panel with the head of the bolt on the outside of the panel and the nut on the inside to ensure clearance for the solar panel that would be mounted over the bolt on the outside of the structure. The next components to be fixed to the structure were the solar panels. These were installed in a similar way to the motor mount where the panel was positioned in its correct position and then the holes were drilled through the mount. This was repeated for all three respective panel mounts. The solar panels were then installed in the mounts with the spacer as shown in figure 4.3. The holes for the solar panel wires were drilled out using a larger Â¼ inch drill bit. With the wires threaded through into the body the panels were then secured in place with a bolt in each corner. Once all the solar panels were installed, it was time to install and wire the power system.</p>
                <p>The PCU consists of four batteries and the Adafruit Boost charger. The four batteries were connected by a tin strip and then spot welded together to ensure efficient power transfer between the cells. Some soldier was added to the ends of the tin strip away from the cells and the main power and ground wires were ran to the power controller. It was now when the batteries were wrapped in Kapton tape to protect them from shorts and help with heat dissipation. To get power to the raspberry pi, a USB type C connector was cut to length and the power and ground wires were soldiered to the charge controller. This was done to reduce the amount of unnecessary wire inside the CubeSat and therefore weight. The next step was to connect the three solar panels in parallel and then connect one lead back to the battery charging pins. This was done inside the tight confines of the CubeSat to further reduce the needed lengths of wire. Once all the connections were made, the PCU was connected to the structure via zip ties. Due to the size and time constraints of the project, this was chosen as the best option to allow for the completion of the project in a timely manner. </p>
