                    <!-- Page Content-->
                <p>The following section will break down the various task that the satellite will complete into code. The main task that had to be programmed were data transmission, receiving data, encoding, decoding data, the control system, and the imaging system.</p>
                <p>The data transmission code was relatively simple since there were python libraries already made for the LoRa module that is used. The bulk of the work that was required to get the data transmission code completed came from having to transmit the image data automatically every 60 seconds while reading the data from an input file. The code also automatically breaks the image file down into packages to transmit.</p>
                <p>The ground station receiving code is a little more complicated as the project requirements state that all images must be saved individually to the computer. To accomplish this, the ground station must automatically receive the transmitted packets and record them to a file. The ground station writes the data as each packet is received while checking for a designated end string. When the code detects the end string it will save the last packet received and then close the file and create a new one with the same file name + 1.</p>
                <p>The encoding of the images was also very simple. The imaging system outputs an image in a .jpg format and then a function runs that reads the file and converts it to hexadecimal and then saves the converted file as a .txt making it easy for the transmission code to read and transmit. 
                    For decoding, the same task must be completed but in reverse. The code takes the received data in a .txt file format and converts it back into a .jpg image. This was much easier to implement once the encoding had been completed. 
                    </p>
                <p>The code for the control system is the most complex because it contains both inputs and outputs as the control systems response is dynamic. First the raspberry pi reads the input angle from the Sense Hat module and compares it to a desired angle that is found using a time-based function in conjunction with our orbit equations. If the measured angle is outside the range of allowed desired angles the raspberry pi, then sends a command to the motor controller telling it to turn the motor. The motor will continue to spin providing reactionary forces until the desired angle is reached. This runs continuously to keep earth in focus during the mission.</p>
                <p>The last system that required code was the image capturing system. This was also simplified by open-source libraries. The timer code that was written for the data transmission portion was reused here to record a new image every 60 seconds while the code is running. Since there is little variability in what the image capturing system must accomplish, this is the bulk of the code. There are a few lines that define the settings of the image captured by the camera as well as saving the images. In appendix 7, the script written for the image capture system also includes the process for encoding the images to reduce the total number of scripts that will have to be ran at once.</p>
