                                        <p class="words">Swarm is dedicated to creating a highly detailed survey of Earth's geomagnetic field and its temporal evolution as well as the electric field in the atmosphere, by using a satellite constellation that carries sophisticated magnetometers and other instruments.</p>

                                        <h4>The Constellation</h4>
                                        <p class="words">The initial constellation of the mission was achieved on 17 April 2014. Swarm A and C form the lower pair of satellites flying side-by-side (1.4° separation in longitude at the equator) at an altitude of 462 km (initial altitude) and at 87.35° inclination angle, whereas Swarm B is cruising at a higher orbit of 511 km (initial altitude) and at 87.75° inclination angle. Due to the subtle difference in altitude and inclination, the Swarm B orbit drifts slowly away from the Swarm A/C orbits at a rate of about 24°/year (difference in longitude of the ascending node). In October 2021, the orbital planes realigned, Swarm B counter-rotating with respect to Swarm A and C.</p>

                                        <h4>The Maneuvers</h4>
                                        <p class="words">To maximize the scientific return of this conjunction, the Swarm A and C satellites were brought back into the same orbital plane, starting with a maneuver in October 2019 that would slowly reduce the separation in longitude, achieving a perfect alignment at the exact time of the conjunction with Swarm B. During the conjunction, the distance between the Swarm A and C satellites was reduced to only 2 s along the orbit (15 km), which was previously kept between 4–10 s for safety reasons.</p>

It provides scalar measurements of the magnetic field to calibrate the onboard Vector Field Magnetometer. The ASM is an absolute instrument, i.e. it is not subject to changes of its intrinsic parameters over time.</p>
